# Arduino-Hourglass-ADXL345
Arduino MAXX7219 hourglass implemented with ADXL 345 accelerometer

This project is a port of Arduino hourglass by Fabrizio Branca [1].
The code has been modified to allow the use of the ADXL345 acccelerometer.
All files needed to build this project in the Arduino IDE have been placed in one folder.
The main file has a writeup of what connections to make and what libraries are required as well as notes on what changes have been made.
