# Arduino-Hourglass-ADXL345
Arduino MAXX7219 hourglass implemented with ADXL 345 accelerometer

This project is a port of Arduino hourglass by Fabrizio Branca [1].

The code has been modified to allow the use of the ADXL345 acccelerometer.

All files needed to build this project in the Arduino IDE have been placed in one folder.

The "main.ino" file includes a writeup of what connections to make and what libraries are required.

(Pointers to what code has been altered are also included)
